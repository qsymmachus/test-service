Test Service
============

This is a simple service I use to test and experiment with, especially new infrastructure.

For now, it's just a Node HTTP server with a single `GET` endpoint.

Usage
-----

To run the server locally, it's pretty simple, assuming you have `node` installed:

```
node server.js
```

Docker
------
