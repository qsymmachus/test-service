Test Service
============

This is a simple service I use to test and experiment with, especially on new infrastructure.

For now, it's just a Node HTTP server with a single `GET` endpoint.

Usage
-----

The following guide assumes you already have `node` and `npm` installed.

Install all dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Spin up the server:

```
node server.js
```

Docker
